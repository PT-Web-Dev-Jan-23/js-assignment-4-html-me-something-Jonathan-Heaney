      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        From 2015-2021, I was a professional classical pianist and opera coach.
        A large part of my job was to learn operas &amp; play them in rehearsals
        for opera companies; I would serve as the full orchestra, which would be
        incorporated at the end of rehearsals and in performances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning an entire opera is demanding and time-consuming. Many are over
        2 or 3 hours long, most are in a foreign language (which needs to be
        learned), and none were written for piano so many of them are extremely
        difficult to play. Moreover, given that opera has been around since the
        early 1600s, there are far more operas in the repertoire than would be
        possible for any one person to learn in an entire lifetime, much less in
        a few years as a student.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, I explored a dataset of opera performances around the
        world between 2012-2018 to answer the questions that were top of mind
        when I was a pianist: what operas should I learn? Who are the most
        popular composers? What languages/countries produced the most operas?
        For some composers, would I be able to focus on just one of their
        pieces, or would I need to learn multiple from some composers?
        Essentially: what is the most efficient way for me to learn as much of
        the in-demand repertoire as possible, so I could be as hirable and
        effective as possible? I knew that some operas were more important and
        popular than others, but I wanted to quantify that popularity.
      </p>
      <h2>Dataset/Cleaning</h2>
      <p>
        This dataset was a comprehensive list of opera performances. The
        original was found on Kaggle, at
        <a
          href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/world-s-largest-database-of-opera-performances"
          target="_blank"
          >this link</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        To clean the dataset and ensure its accuracy, I took the following
        steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Removed columns that were unnecessary for my analysis, including
          season, production, type, and start date
        </li>
        <li>
          Cleaned the composer nationality column by looking up all composers
          that had null values
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully checked the composers and piece titles for entries that
          didn't belong
          <ul>
            <li>
              For example, I saw several oratorios on the list by composers such
              as Bach, Beethoven, and Handel. Oratorio is a similar genre to
              opera, but distinct enough that I felt they should be removed.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's highly possible that some non-operas still slipped through
              the cracks; however, these would only be pieces that received a
              few performances total and would not materially affect the
              conclusions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Converted ISO country codes to country names, for better readability
          on composer nationality and performance country columns.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Dataset Caveats</h4>
      <p>
        The main caveat of this dataset is that it only includes up to 2018.
        Normally this lack of immediate recency wouldn't be relevant; however,
        the COVID pandemic and social justice conversations in the wake of
        George Floyd protests have had a resounding impact on the classical
        music and opera worlds, as everywhere else. I would be interested to see
        a dataset in a few years from now incorporating these changes to
        determine any tangible impact on the composers being performed and
        stories being told in opera.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important caveat to keep in mind is that many smaller opera
        companies, particularly in the United States, would likely be left out
        of a dataset such as this. It would be very difficult to keep an
        accurate count of every single operatic performance, especially ones
        that only have a small audience of dozens. At least in the US, a lot of
        the most innovative programming of newer and lesser-known composers
        happens at these small grassroots companies, which wouldn't be reflected
        in this dataset.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, this dataset of course only has data on operas that have been
        performed, not that have been written but never performed in this date
        range. Most pieces by famous composers receive at least a performance or
        two somewhere in the world, but there's a possibility that not all
        written works are represented here.
      </p>
      <h2>Analysis Tools/Methods</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, I used Excel/Google Sheets to clean the dataset and
        store the results of the queries, SQL to analyze the data and Tableau
        for visualization.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <h4>Opera composition is a winner-take-all field.</h4>
      <p>
        The main takeaway is that opera performances are dominated to an extreme
        degree by power laws. This means that performances are very unevenly
        distributed: although there are thousands of pieces in existence, a
        much, much smaller number gets performed with any regularity. The same
        is true for composers; there are many of them, but a small number
        dominate the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        The
        <a
          href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-pareto-principle-the-8020-rule/"
          target="_blank"
          >Pareto Principle</a
        >
        states that 80% of outcomes come from 20% of causes, but opera is
        actually even more extreme in this regard. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The top 8 composers (out of 1,411) make up 52% of total performances.
        </li>
        <li>
          80% of performances come from 3% of composers.
          <a
            href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/opera_stats/8020ComposerPareto_1"
            target="_blank"
            >Graph</a
          >
        </li>

        <li>
          The top 38 operas (out of 2,863 in this dataset) make up 50% of total
          performances.
        </li>
        <li>
          80% of performances come from 7.9% of operas.
          <a
            href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/opera_stats/8020WorkPareto"
            target="_blank"
            >Graph</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Though a lot of composer nationalities were represented (69 total), the
        top 4 (all European) represent 76% of all performances.
        <a
          href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/opera_stats/NationalityPareto"
          target="_blank"
          >Graph</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The outputs of many individual composers also follow a power law- for
        example, Mozart wrote 21 operas, but 90% of his performances came from
        his top 5.
        <a
          href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/opera_stats/MozartPareto"
          target="_blank"

        >

      <p>
        These statistics may not be good news for the health of the opera
        industry as a whole, but they do provide some pretty clear takeaways for
        someone who was in my position:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize the popular works of Verdi, Mozart, and Puccini.</li>
        <li>
          Learn extremely popular operas not by the above three composers:
          <ul>
            <li><em>Carmen</em> by Bizet</li>
            <li><em>Il barbiere di Siviglia</em> by Rossini</li>
            <li><em>Die Fledermaus</em> by Johann Strauss</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Learn the top-performed opera by the most popular composers not
          already listed:
          <ul>
            <li><em>L'elisir d'amore</em> by Donizetti</li>
            <li><em>Der fliegende Hollander</em> by Wagner</li>
            <li><em>Eugene Onegin</em> by Tchaikovsky</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          In terms of language learning: prioritize Italian above all else,
          followed by German, followed by French.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most composers maintain similar styles throughout their careers, so by
        focusing on these few operas by these composers, one could cover an
        extremely high percentage of all the composers/works that one would be
        expected to know.
      </p>
      <h4>To get good at writing operas, you need to write a lot of them.</h4>
      <p>
        Opera is a difficult medium for composition. A composer has to consider
        the plot, character development, lyrics, melody, orchestration, and on
        and on. Given the demands, it's perhaps not surprising that most
        composers don't write a hit opera on their first try. The most popular
        opera by a composer who wrote only one is Beethoven's Fidelio, with 748
        performances. It's the 36th-most-popular (and Beethoven re-wrote it so
        many times over the course of many years that it almost can't count as
        the first try).
      </p>
      <p>Some more statistics to put this in perspective:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Verdi, Mozart, and Puccini, the most-performed composers, wrote,
          respectively, 28, 21, and 13 operas.
        </li>
        <li>
          All composers with over 1,000 performances overall wrote at least 3
          operas.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the top 10 composers, the mean number of operas written was 19.
          Only Bizet (4) and Tchaikovsky (8) were in single digits.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The caveat that this dataset doesn't include all written works, only
        performed works, strengthens this argument. Some composers may have
        written even more pieces, but they are so forgotten that they received 0
        performances in this period.
        <a
          href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/opera_stats/Worksvs_Performances"
          target="_blank"
          >Graph</a
        >
      </p>

      <h4>The gender distribution of performances is extreme.</h4>
      <p>
        Opera composition has been a male-dominated field for a long time, for
        both complex and not-so-complex reasons. But that historical disparity
        is still relevant in contemporary performances of opera- out of 140,537
        performances, only 1,093, or 0.78%, were for pieces composed by women.
        <a
          href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/opera_stats/GenderBreakdown"
          target="_blank"
          >Graph</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>Some more worrying numbers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are 146 male composers who received more performances than the
          most-performed female composer, Kaija Saariaho.
          <a
            href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/opera_stats/TopFemaleComposer"
            target="_blank"
            >Graph</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          There are 317 works by male composers that received more performances
          than the most-performed opera by a female composer.
          <ul>
            <li>
              This opera,
              <em>Der satanarchaolugenialkohollische Wunschpunsch</em> by
              Elisabeth Naske, was written specifically for children, putting it
              arguably in a different category than most operas on this list.
              There are 387 operas by male composers with more performances than
              the most-performed work by a woman that wasn't written for
              children: <em>As One</em> by Laura Kaminsky.
              <a
                href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jonathan.heaney/viz/opera_stats/TopFemaleWork"
                target="_blank"
                >Graph</a
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This would be one of the most interesting trends to observe in recent
        years, post-2020. Programming more pieces by members of
        under-represented groups in opera has been a major point of discussion
        in recent years, more so than it was in the mid-2010s.
